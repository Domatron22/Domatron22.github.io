                    <p class="blog-post-meta">September 09, 2022 by Domatron</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p> This was my first car, that I bought in High School. My father and started teaching me a lot
                        about car's and got me hooked into the whole automotive culture. So, thank you dad for all your
                        help and support through the years.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p> Calcifer or Cal was the name of this beloved vehicle. I bought it in 2015 for somewhere between
                        $1,000.00 and $2,000.00 (I honestly don’t remember exactly how much). I had taken a look at a few
                        other Camaro's and Firebird's from the same generation and this one I had my heart set on. It
                        was down in NJ somewhere, and it was drivable, with really no issues with the car, just some
                        small cosmetic issues.</p>
                    <p> YES, Cal is named after the fire demon in Howls Moving Castle, it just kind of fit. So, A little bit
                        about Cal, she housed a 3.8L v6, that got appx. 18-26 ish mpg in the beginning.
                        The radio had already been swapped out with a Pioneer radio that had Bluetooth so that was nice.
                        She also had remote start, and that was honestly awesome in the winter in the morning before
                        school.
                        So, what were the downfalls? Well in the beginning, it was nothing! But as the days/months went
                        by. Some interesting things started popping up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First issue: Occasionally when going over bumps, the radio, windows and pretty much all
                        accessories would just turn off, and not come back on until after the car was restarted.
                        Interesting right? Well, this problem actually stemmed from how the remote start was installed.
                        Apparently, the remote start that was installed, if you pressed the remote start button twice or
                        something like that, the windows would roll down as the car started. Pretty neat, but when
                        improperly wired, it casued some funky issues. That was a simple fix to the BCM or Body
                        Control Module, which was located on the passenger side of the car behind the glove box.
                        Alright! So now the car no longer hiccupped at bumps! What next?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, months after I had bought the car, A very large problem became very apparent to me when I
                        was driving to school one morning, The car just shut off. What the heck? What could it have
                        been? At first, I thought it was electrical, for I had heard the Alternator was whining. After the
                        alternator was replaced, the problem happened again, at pretty much the same place in my commute
                        to school.
                        Now this was concerning. So, I had it towed back to my parents’ house, and after school my father
                        and I took a look. And what we found was not so great. The oil was a brownish, orange color.
                        Know where this is going? Yep, the intake manifold gasket had blown. Allowing the coolant to get
                        into the oil. Yeah this was not good. With no coolant in the engine, this could have posed
                        serious problems for the engine. Crack heads, warped pistons, etc. this was a big threat.
                        First we needed to figure out HOW we were going to get to the lower parts of the engine. The
                        engine definately wasn't coming out of the engine compartment like old crate moters my Dad was
                        use to. In this case, the body of the car would have to be lifted up in order to actually acess
                        the engine. Yeah. Now how would we do that? It's not like we are a well equipped shop with a
                        4-point lift. When my dad was younger, they used a large tree limb to help get engines out of
                        cars,
                        but we didnt have that. So my Dad came up with the brilliant idea of purcahsing scaffolding, and
                        putting a large beam at the top to be the equivelant of that old tree limb, and use a chain
                        hoist. Now let me tell you, this had to have been the sketchiest thing this high school junior
                        had seen hahaha. The pictures are shown below, and as you can see we were able to successfully
                        disconnect all of the points that were mounted to the body of the car and drop the engine.
                        Now the real work could begin. With this kind of access, it made it super easy to remove the
                        intake manifold, heads, water pump you name it, it was right there, with all the room you could
                        think of. As we took apart the engine, we noticed that there was no crack in the heads, no
                        warping, everything looked fine. This was a huge relief. The price of the project had just gone
                        down. So, we purchased a whole engine gasket kit, cleaned up all of the parts, had the heads
                        re-surfaced and sterted putting everything back together.
                        Things were great! When reassembling the heads, make sure to always be careful, for some parts
                        are aluminum, and will be very easy to strip and crossthread if you are not careful. I find that
                        turning a bolt backwards until i feel the final thread tick over the thread entrance then start
                        hand tightening helps. After the engine was back together, we ran some Marvel Mystery Oil
                        through the engine a few times to get any residual gunk out. After that, she was running again!
                        And honestly, it felt and started better than ever.
                        This could have very well been one of the reasons that the car was sold in the first place,
                        maybe the previous owner used some stop leak or something to keep it running to be able to sell
                        it before it died. But hey, she was back on the road, and now, the fuel economy had actually
                        improved quite a bit. We were now running an average of 28mpg, and the best I ever clocked after
                        a long trip was 33mpg. Pretty damn good. To be honest, that was pretty much it for the main
                        issues. Honestly, If you have the chance to buy one of those 3800 series II engines, I would
                        reccomend it.
                        <p>
                        Also, I might add, that the Buick Park Avenue Ultra from that generation, had the same engine...
                        but with a supercharger. So if you are looking for a small boost of power that is somewhat
                        stock, take a look around for one of those bad boys and install the computer and the
                        supercharger from the Buick. I never found one, but I would reccomend giving it a try.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other miscalaneous tweaks include the upgraded LED Halo headlights (Very nice both asthetic and performance wise). A new Poineer stereo to replace the old Pioneer stereo,a long with sone sweet poineer speakers. The whole catbakc system was replaces with an Flowmaster Exhaust system. This system had a resonater so the car would sound deeper, and my did it sound nice for a V6. Also purchased some performance Powerstop calipers.
